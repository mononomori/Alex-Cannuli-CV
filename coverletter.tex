        % ----- Greeting -----
Dear FORM Athletica Hiring Manager,\\

\vspace{1em}

        % ----- Introduction Paragraph -----
I am writing to express my interest in the Web Developer Co-op position at FORM Athletica Inc. 

As a software developer with an appreciation for recreational athletics (more specifically rock climbing), I am particularly drawn to FORM’s mission to enhance the athletic experience with augmented reality technologies. Additionally, the prospect of contributing to a company founded in Vancouver, my home city, is especially appealing to me, as I feel that we have a shared cultural identity rooted in a passion for athletics, our beautiful outdoors, and technological innovation.

        % ----- Body Paragraph 1 -----
During my recent project, harmonIQ, I helped develop a full-stack web application that generated personalized music quizzes using users’ Spotify listening data. Working on a small team required me to be flexible in my duties and contribute to both client-side and server-side development. I greatly enjoyed the amount of internal communication that working in a close team offers, and by utilizing a Kanban-style workflow, I gained hands-on experience with multiple facets of development through our prioritized task list. Some of the main tasks which I contributed to include UI design, server configuration, and writing both private and public application documentation. In addition, I have designed and implemented interactive software in both Java and C\#, including video games built in both the Unity and Unreal Engine game engines, where optimizing for the user experience was key. These experiences, along with my studies in Human-Centered Computing, UI/UX design, and game development, have provided me with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, as well as a keen eye for user-first development.

        % ----- Body Paragraph 2 -----

In addition to my technical skills, I bring a strong background in teamwork, communication, and thriving in fast-paced environments. My experience as a shift supervisor at 49th Parallel Café has taught me how to maintain composure while effectively coordinating team members by strategically prioritizing and assigning tasks during high-pressure situations. As this was a customer-facing position, I developed strong interpersonal skills and learned to communicate effectively with a diverse range of people. These experiences have helped me build strong organizational and interpersonal abilities, which I believe are essential for succeeding in FORM’s collaborative and dynamic environment. I am eager to contribute my skills not only as a developer, but also as a dedicated team member committed to continuous learning and shared success.

        % ----- Closing Paragraph -----

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to a team that is an innovative leader in athletic-focused augmented reality, and I am confident that my technical skills, passion for user-first development, and dedication to enhancing the athletic user experience will make me a valuable contributor to the FORM Athletica team. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can help push the boundaries of what is possible with augmented reality and athletics.
