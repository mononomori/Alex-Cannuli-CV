        % ----- Greeting -----
Dear FORM Athletica Hiring Manager,\\

\vspace{1em}

        % ----- Introduction Paragraph -----
As someone who has spent countless hours optimizing user interfaces for seamless performance, I understand that the difference between good technology and transformative technology lies in how intuitively it integrates into users' experiences. When I discovered FORM's augmented reality swim goggles and their ability to provide useful metrics without disrupting a swimmer's flow, I knew this was exactly the kind of innovative, user-first technology I want to help build.

As a Vancouver-based software developer with a passion for both recreational athletics and cutting-edge technology, FORM's mission to revolutionize the athletic experience through augmented reality perfectly aligns with my interests and technical expertise in full-stack web development.

        % ----- Body Paragraph 1 -----
My technical foundation directly addresses FORM's need for a developer who can contribute to both client and server-side development while maintaining focus on the user experience. During my development of harmonIQ, a full-stack web application that generated personalized music quizzes using Spotify's API, I gained hands-on experience with the exact skills FORM requires: JavaScript development (React), backend development (REST API), and external integration (Spotify). Working in a small, agile team, I contributed to UI design, server configuration, and comprehensive documentation while utilizing Kanban workflows to prioritize and deliver features efficiently. My experience developing interactive software in Unity and Unreal Engine has also strengthened my ability to optimize for intuitive user interfaces, particularly important for augmented reality systems where seamless performance is essential.

        % ----- Body Paragraph 2 -----

The dynamic, fast-paced environment at FORM requires someone who can excel under pressure while maintaining clear communication across diverse teams. My experience as a shift supervisor at 49th Parallel Café taught me to coordinate multiple team members effectively during high-pressure situations, strategically prioritizing tasks while maintaining quality standards. This customer-facing role developed my ability to communicate complex information clearly to diverse audiences—a crucial skill when collaborating with mobile app developers, UX/UI teams, and stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds. These experiences have prepared me to thrive in FORM's startup-style environment where wearing multiple hats and maintaining exceptional communication are essential for success.

        % ----- Closing Paragraph -----

FORM's position at the forefront of augmented reality innovation in athletics represents exactly the kind of challenging, meaningful work that drives my passion for technology. My proven ability to deliver modular, well-tested code combined with my dedication to user-centered development makes me well-positioned to contribute immediately to your team's success. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills and collaborative approach can help FORM continue breaking down barriers in sports technology.

Please feel free to contact me through the co-op office to arrange an interview at your convenience.
